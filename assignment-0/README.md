## Setup and Core concepts of CNSS (Computer Networks Simple Simulator)


RC2020 Labs will use CNSS for part of the semester (probably in 4 out of the 6 programming assignments). CNSS makes it possible to code and simulate simple networking protocols. The simulation results are deterministic and repeatable, making it easier to reproduce and interpret them.

In this assignment we will first cover the basics of CNSS. Firstly, how and where to fetch the source code, how to compile the code and execute the simulator. Then we will learn about the basic components: nodes and links that will be used to simulate simple computer networks and networking protocols.

Open the notebook **assignment-0.ipynb** above (the file with extension .ipynb) and follow its instructions. You can also press the Open in Colab button in the file and execute it online using the Google Colab application.

Zip file assignment-0-cnss-files.zip contains all the assignment 0 java source files and config.txt files shown in the tutorial above. If you install by hand the CNSS simulator (either in the command line or Eclipse) you can use these files for testing purposes in your own computer.
